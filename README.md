## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

During this project, I learned that creating a design system with utility classes and custom properties at the beginning of the project can significantly speed up the process of building pages. To ensure responsiveness on different screen sizes,I adopted a mobile-first workflow.
